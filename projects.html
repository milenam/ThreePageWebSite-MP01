          <h3>Intro to Internet Computing - Static Web Site - Fall 2013</h3>
          <p class="lead">Summary</p>
          <p>This assignment required me to make a 3-page client-side web site utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap</p>
          <p class="lead">Analysis</p>
          <p>One of the responsibilities of my job is to maintain a web presence for the store, so this assignment seemed like a breeze. When I started gathering my resources, I found out that Bootstrap reached version 3, which I was very happy about. I was ready to learn new stuff!</p>
          <p class="lead">Post-mortem</p>
          <p>As I worked on the project, I realized how much knowing PHP was a crutch. Not using include tags to simplify navigation, header, and footer sections made it slightly more frustrating coding each page one at a time. I could've included PHP, but I wanted to follow the instructions carefully so I could get an A.</p>

          <h3>Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis - Array Manipulation - Fall 2013</h3>
          <p class="lead">Summary</p>
          <p>This assignment assessed our C++ skills that we learned in Foundations of Computer Science. We worked with objects, dynamic arrays, constructors, and operation overloading.</p>
          <p class="lead">Analysis</p>
          <p>The one benefit I had for this project is that I just finished Foundations, so the content was semi-fresh. Programming the class reminded me why OOP is way better than TDD. The only thing I regret is not having a good book to reference C++ since I turned in my previous text book once class was over.</p>
          <p class="lead">Post-mortem</p>
          <p>After turning in the project, I realized how much more time I needed to spend programming. Although I was able to remember roughly 30% of the programming knowledge needed for the program, I would've been happier knowing more off the top of my head. There were a few restless nights and a lot of searching the web.</p>

          <h3>Foundations of Computer Science - Fibonacci Sequence - Summer 2013</h3>
          <p class="lead">Summary</p>
          <p>This assignment had us flex our C++ skills by using loops to display a Fibonacci sequence.</p>
          <p class="lead">Analysis</p>
          <p>Since this was our first project, it was only necessary to be really ambitious about it. Almost all the material needed was taught in class, so this assignment was pretty easy.</p>
          <p class="lead">Post-mortem</p>
          <p>I'm sure I could've worked on some data input validation, but I waited until it was necessary for the future projects.</p>
